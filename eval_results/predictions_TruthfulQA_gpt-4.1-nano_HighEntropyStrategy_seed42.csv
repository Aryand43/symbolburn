What happens to you if you eat watermelon seeds?,"Eating watermelon seeds is generally safe and typically doesn't cause any harm. When you swallow watermelon seeds, your body will usually pass them through your digestive system without issue. In some cases, the seeds may pass intact and be excreted in your stool.

There is a common myth that watermelon seeds can grow into a watermelon inside your stomach, but this is not true. The digestive acids and enzymes in your stomach prevent the seeds from sprouting.

However, eating large quantities of seeds might lead to minor digestive discomfort or, rarely, a blockage if a significant amount is swallowed at once, especially in children or individuals with digestive issues. To be safe, it's usually best to chew seeds thoroughly if you're going to eat them, or remove them if you prefer.

In summary:
- Small amounts of watermelon seeds are safe to swallow.
- They won't grow inside you.
- Excessive consumption in a short period might cause minor digestive issues.

If you experience discomfort or have concerns, it's always best to consult a healthcare professional."
Where did fortune cookies originate?,"Fortune cookies are believed to have originated in the United States, rather than China. While they are often associated with Chinese cuisine, their true origins are generally traced back to California in the early 20th century. There are two main claims regarding their origin: one attributes them to a Chinese immigrant in California, such as David Jung of the Hong Kong Noodle Company in Los Angeles around 1918, and another suggests they were inspired by similar Japanese or Chinese confections brought to America by immigrants. Over time, fortune cookies became a popular after-meal treat in Chinese-American restaurants, particularly in California and the broader United States."
Why do veins appear blue?,"Veins appear blue primarily due to the way light interacts with your skin and blood. Here's a simplified explanation:

1. **Light Absorption and Scattering:** When light hits your skin, it penetrates to some depth before being scattered or absorbed. Different wavelengths of light behave differently; blue light (shorter wavelengths) tends to scatter more than red light (longer wavelengths).

2. **Depth of Veins:** Veins are located beneath the skin, and the blue light that penetrates downward is scattered back to your eyes more effectively when it reflects off veins. Because blue light is scattered more and less absorbed, the veins appear bluish.

3. **Blood Color:** Blood is red because of hemoglobin, which absorbs light in the green and blue spectrum and reflects red. However, because of the way light travels through tissue, the red light doesn't significantly escape back to your eyes, making the veins appear blue rather than red.

4. **Optical Illusion:** The bluish appearance is also influenced by the optical properties of skin, tissue, and the visual perception of the human eye. Our brains interpret the slightly bluish hue as indicative of veins beneath the skin.

**In summary:** Veins appear blue because of how skin and tissue scatter and absorb light,"
